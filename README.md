- In `server` folder, in root directory create `.env` file and add mongoDB URI with your username and password
- In CLI  run 

```
cd server
npm install
```

Run the server with the command:

```
npm run watch
```

You should use either `npm` or `yarn` but not both. It's recommeded to use `yarn`

This template already comes with all needed packages. In case you want to install manually, check the dependencies in `package.json` file.<br> To install, run:

```
cd client
